# Front-end developer challeng to Linx

## Technologies
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
</ul>

## Libs

<p>I used the sweetalert library to return the form</p>

## Priorities
<p>I separated the development by stages, first I focused on creating the html and css to bring the prototype to life, when I finished this stage, I created the product component and integrated it with the available API, together with what was already done, and to finish the project I checked in the item-by-item design to make sure it was the way it was requested.
</p>

## How to build

<p>I used the vscode extension (Live server) to run in the browser, I don't recommend opening the file directly from the folder, as it won't open with css and js.

<ul>

<li>display grid</li>
<li>media query</li>
</ul>
